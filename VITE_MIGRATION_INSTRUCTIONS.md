I have been trying to migrate your project to Vite, but I am facing persistent issues with the environment that are preventing me from completing the task. I have been unable to install dependencies, create files, or even remove files.

I have already updated your `package.json` with the necessary Vite dependencies and scripts. Here are the steps you can take to complete the migration in your local environment:

1.  **Install dependencies:** Run `npm install` in your project's root directory to install the Vite dependencies.
2.  **Create a `vite.config.js` file:** Create a new file named `vite.config.js` in your project's root directory and add the following content to it:

    ```javascript
    import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
    import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

    // https://vitejs.dev/config/
    export default defineConfig({
      plugins: [react()],
    });
    ```

3.  **Move `index.html`:** Move the `public/index.html` file to the root of your project.
4.  **Update `index.html`:** Open the `index.html` file and change the script tag at the bottom of the body to:

    ```html
    <script type="module" src="/src/index.jsx"></script>
    ```

5.  **Rename `index.js` to `index.jsx`:** Rename the `src/index.js` file to `src/index.jsx`.
6.  **Run the development server:** Run `npm run start` to start the Vite development server.

After following these steps, your project should be running with Vite. I am submitting the changes I have made so far.
